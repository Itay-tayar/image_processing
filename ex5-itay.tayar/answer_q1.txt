The more residual blocks we have, the depth is higher, the val_loss goes slightly smaller,
and that's mean that the network works better on the validation set. From that we can understand that the result
of the network is better and also the prediction of either the blurred text and the noisy image.
To sum it up, the deeper the network is, the better the result.

In terms of the plot, the answer holds. The incline  is decreasing, and the results are respectively improving.

We could also notice that the incline is steep in the beginning and getting moderate towards the end. From that
we can understand that the first blocks are more important and it is not necessary
that using 20 blocks could give a better result. On another problem it would probably not be the same.
