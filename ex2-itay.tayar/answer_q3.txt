Question 3 answer:
The difference between the two derivative is that in the convolution derivative,
we used an approximation of the derivative formula by calculating the difference between two close pixels.
On the other hand in the fourier derivative, we used the fourier transform of the
exact derivative formula, which it's not an approximation of it.
