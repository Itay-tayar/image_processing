Question 1 answer:
In the "change_samples" function, we convert the signal to the frequency domain
by using DFT, and we delete some of the highest frequencies.
In "change_rate" function, the speed up happens by reducing the intervals between
the samples (reducing the time between playing each sample) in the time domain. In the frequency
domain, it will change the frequencies to higher frequencies.
That's why in "change_samples" function we don't get higher frequencies than the original signal.
More than that, the high frequencies are less significant for the signal than the lower frequencies,
so the general structure of the signal doesn't change.
